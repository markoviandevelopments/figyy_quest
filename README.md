# figyy_quest

**figyy_quest** is an experimental project aimed at creating a navigable 3D world using the [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) library in **C**. This project serves as a stepping stone for learning **C** programming with a focus on graphics, building a foundation for future evolutionary simulations, and gaining experience with game servers.

## Goals

1. **Learn C for Graphics Programming**
   - Develop proficiency in **C**, particularly in the context of 3D rendering and graphics.
   - Explore the capabilities of the raylib library.

2. **Build a 3D Navigable World**
   - Create a simple 3D world where players can move and explore.
   - Experiment with basic 3D modeling, texturing, and lighting.

3. **Prepare for Evolutionary Simulations**
   - Use the knowledge gained here to create more sophisticated simulations involving evolutionary principles.

4. **Gain Game Server Experience**
   - Lay the groundwork for integrating server-client interactions in future projects.

## Project Status

This project is in its **early stages**. At this point:
- We are still defining the scope and mechanics of the 3D world.
- The focus is on experimenting with raylib to understand how it handles 3D objects, movement, and rendering.

Expect frequent updates and breaking changes as we refine our approach.

## Features (Planned)

- A basic 3D environment.
- Navigable world using keyboard and mouse inputs.
- Simple 3D assets and textures.
- Basic lighting and shading.
- Experimentation with potential server-client interactions (future milestone).
